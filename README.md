#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to software development. It involves designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems in a structured and efficient manner.
IMPORTANCE:
Ensures High-Quality Software:Software engineering applies structured methodologies like Agile, DevOps, and Waterfall to produce high-quality software that is efficient, secure, and user-friendly.
Enhances Efficiency and Productivity:By using best practices, coding standards, and automation tools, software engineering improves development speed and reduces errors.
Supports Innovation and Growth:Many technological advancements, including artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and blockchain, rely on software engineering to develop and scale applications.
Improves Security and Reliability:Software engineering ensures secure coding practices, reducing vulnerabilities and protecting users from cyber threats.
Reduces Development Costs:Proper planning, testing, and maintenance reduce software failures and costly fixes, making development more cost-effective.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

 Introduction of the Term "Software Engineering" (1968)
The term was first introduced at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference to address the growing "software crisis."
At the time, software development was chaotic, leading to frequent project failures, high costs, and unreliable software.
This milestone emphasized the need for structured methodologies, documentation, and best practices in software development.

The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (1970s-1980s)
OOP revolutionized software design by organizing code into reusable objects rather than relying on procedural programming.
Key contributions:
Languages like Smalltalk, C++, and later Java introduced OOP concepts.
Enabled modular, reusable, and maintainable code, reducing complexity.
Led to the development of modern software design principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

 The Emergence of Agile Methodologies (2001)
 Traditional software development models (like Waterfall) were too rigid for fast-changing requirements.
The Agile Manifesto (2001) introduced a new approach focused on:
Iterative development (frequent releases instead of a single final product).
Collaboration between developers and customers for continuous feedback.
Flexibility to adapt to changes.
Agile methodologies (e.g., Scrum, Kanban) now dominate modern software engineering, especially in startups and tech companies.

   List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

PLANNING: defines project goals,scope,budget and timeline.identifies risks and feasibility.
REQIUIREMENT ANALYSIS: gathers and documents user and system requirements, ensures cvlarityon functionalities and constaints.
DESIGN:Creates system architecture, user interface, and database design.Defines software structure and technologies to be used.
Implementation (Coding):Developers write and integrate code based on the design.The core functionality of the software is built.
Testing:Identifies and fixes bugs, ensuring the software works as expected.Includes unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing.
Deployment:Software is released to users or production environment.May involve staged or full-scale rollout.
Maintenance & Support:Fixes bugs, updates features, and improves performance.Ensures long-term stability and user satisfaction.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

COMPARISON
both are software development methodologiesused to manage and execute projects.
both aim to deliver high-qualitysoftware that meets user and business needs.
both involve planning,designing,coding,testing and deployment though they follow different approaches.
CONTRAST
waterfall has a linear and sequential flow;each phase must be completed before moving to the next while agile has iterative and flexible;development happens in cycles.
waterfall is rigid;difficult toimplement changes once development starts while agileagile is highly flexible in that changes can be made at any stage.
waterfall has minimal customer involvementafter initial planning feedback is taken only at the end while agile has continouous customer involvement; customers give feedback regularly
in waterfall the final product is delivered at the end of development while agile working versions of the software are delivered frequently
waterfall testing is done after the development phase is completed while agile testing id done continuously throughoughtthe cdevelopment cycle.
waterfall has a higher risk management as problems discovered late are codtly to fix whlie agile has a lower risk managementas issues are identified and fixed early
WATERFALL METHODOLOGY SCENARIOS: large-scale infrastructure projects,goverment or millitaryt projects, medical software development
AGILE METHODOLOGYSCENARIOS: startups and fast- paced tech companies,E-commerce platforms,game development


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPER: role: designing,coding and implementing software solutions Responsiblities:writing clean and efficient and mainatainable code,developing new software features and fixing bugs,collaborating with designers and other developers,writing documentation for code and system processes.
QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER: role:endures that software meets quality standards before release. RESPONSIBILITIES: designing test plans and test cases, executing manual and automated tests to identify bugs, conducting performance,security and usability testing, ensuring the software meetsfunctional and non-functional requirements 
PROJECT MANAGER: role:oversees the software development process to ensure timely delivery and alignment iwth business goals. Responsibilities: defining project scope,objectives and deliverables, planning and scheduling tasks using project management tools,coordinating between developers,QA enginers,stakeholders and clients.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)Importance:Enhanced Productivity,Improved Code Quality,Simplified Debugging,Streamlined Build and Deployment.Examples:Visual Studio (Microsoft),IntelliJ IDEA (JetBrains), VS Code (Microsoft),Xcode (Apple).
Version Control Systems (VCS)Importance:Collaboration,Tracking Changes,Branching and Merging,Code Backup and Recovery,Auditing and Accountability. Examples:Git,GitHub,GitLab,Bitbucket

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Debbuging complex code.STRATEGY: use debbuging tools eg.visual studio debugger,writing unit tests to catch issues early,follow code reviews to get fresh perspectives.
Keeping up with rapidly changing technologies:new frameworks,programming languages and tools emerge frequently.STRATEGY: set aside time for continious learning,join developer communities and attend meetups to stay updated
Managing tight deadlines and workload.STRATEGY: use agile and scrum methodologies to break work into manageable sprints,priortize work using the eisenhower matrix(urgent vs. important)
handling code complexity and technical debt. STRATEGY: follow best practices likesolid principles and design patterns,use version controlsystems (Git) to manage changes efficiently.
Security vulnerabilities: cybersecurity threats like data breaches STRATEGY: follow secure coding practices(eg input validation,encryption),use penetration testing to identify weaknesses.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

UNIT TESTING: involves testing individual components or functions of a software application in isolation to ensure they work correctly.IMPORTANCE: Identifies bugs early in the development process .
INTEGRATION TESTING: tests how different modules or components of a system interact with each other after they have been individually tested.IMPORTANCE: Ensures smooth communication between modulesand helps detect issues such as incorrect API calls, database connectionfailures , or incompatible components.
SYSTEM TESTING:evaluates the entire software application as a wholee to verify that it meets functional and non-functional requirements.IMPORTANCE:ensures the complete system behaves as expected and detects issues related to performance,security,usability and compatibility.
ACCEPTANCE TESTING:software is evaluated against business requirements to determine if it is ready for deployment.IMPORTANCE: confirms the software meets user needs and business goals.It also ensures that the system is ready for real-world use.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining inputs to optimize the output of AI modules. Prompt engineering improves accuracy in that by giving precise instructions we reduce misunderstandings and incorrect otputs. It also enhances response quality as well structured prompts help AI generate clear,detailed and useful answers.prompt engineering saves time as a well-crafted prompt minimizes the need for follow-up questions or corrections.Other importances include optimize AI performance and Customizes output.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
'tell me about accounting" Improved "can you explain the basic principles of accounting,incluiding assets,liabilities,revenues ,equity and expenses?"
The improved prompt is more effective as it specifies what aspects of accounting should be covered and it also ensures that the response is structured and relevant.
